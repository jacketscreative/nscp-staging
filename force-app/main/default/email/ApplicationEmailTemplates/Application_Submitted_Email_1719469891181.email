This is to confirm your application has been received.<br />
<br />
You can expect to hear back from us within 5 business days. An application that is incomplete or incorrect will result in delays.<br />
<br />
It is important that you advise your employer that you should not commit to accepting shifts until you have received email notification from the NSCP that your licence has been processed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please return to the MY APPLICATIONS tab to complete your pharmacist injection permit application. As a reminder, you will need a valid CPR/First Aid certificate to apply. Once your pharmacist licence is issued, your Injection Technical Permit is no longer valid. If you have not done so already, please apply now.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</span></span></body>
