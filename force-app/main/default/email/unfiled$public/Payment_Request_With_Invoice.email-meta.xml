    <textOnly>Dear {!ChargentOrders__Payment_Request__c.ChargentOrders__Billing_Contact__c}

We&apos;ve received your application; however, the licence renewal process is NOT complete until payment is received by the NSCP. Please find attached an invoice that shows the amount owing.

This invoice can be paid by logging into your NSCP account and by using the following payment methods:

Credit Card (Visa or Mastercard only)
Visa Debit
Mastercard Debit


Or, a cheque or money order may be mailed to the NSCP office. If you are mailing a cheque or money order to the NSCP office, it is important to include your name and licence number, and to indicate what the payment is for.

Once your payment is processed, a receipt will be available for you to download from your NSCP account.

PLEASE NOTE: The licence fee must be received by the NSCP no later than November 30 to avoid a late fee, regardless of whether payment is made online, by mail, or is being paid by your employer.

Please click on the link below to make a secure online payment:
