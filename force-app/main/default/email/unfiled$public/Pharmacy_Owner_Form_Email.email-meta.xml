Dear {!customerName}

Please find attached the Pharmacy Licence Renewal Application  form that you completed, which now needs to be signed by the Pharmacy Owner or Pharmacy Owner&apos;s Representative.

Please forward the application to this person before submitting it to the NSCP no later than November 30. The form can be submitted by mail, email (registrations@nspharmacists.ca), or fax (902-701-3540).

Thank you for your cooperation.

Please note: A pharmacy licence is not officially renewed until the NSCP has (1) received payment; (2) received the owner&apos;s signature on the Pharmacy Licence Renewal Application; and (3) approved the renewal application.
